# Reporting a issue

Have you identified a reproducible problem? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/vlad333000/vscode-sqf/issues) to see if the issue has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular feature requests](https://github.com/vlad333000/vscode-sqf/pulls).

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

👍 - upvote
👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a [new issue](https://github.com/vlad333000/vscode-sqf/issues/new/choose).
